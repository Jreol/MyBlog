            <h3>Cubic Bezzier Function</h3>
            <article>
                <p>I've stumbled upon the Cubic Bezzier Function for CSS. And
                i've figured out I have no Idea what it is. I've stumbled upon
                it on the Free Code Camp <em>Curriculum</em><a target="_blank"
                href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/learn-how-bezier-curves-work/">
                "Applied
                Visual Design: Learn How Bezier Curves Work" </a>. Unfortunately
                I don't understand particularly quite well what it does just
                yet, but from my understanding, the function's parameters requires 4 points (p0, p1, p2,
                p3). The starting point (p0) is always at x=0, and y=0, along a
                "1 x 1" grid. Likewise with the last point (p3), it is always
                located at x=1, and y=1. The remaining points are p1, and p2.</p>
