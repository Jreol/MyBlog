        <h1>My Progress Today Wed 09-January-2019</h1>
        <p>Today, I've started my learning progress on Front End Web
        Development. And what better way to track my progress by creating a blog
        on a daily/weekly progress. Unfortunately, I am not
        the best writer, however I aim to make this blog as pleasant to read as
        possible</p>
        <p>Starting the project, I looked into using Git-Hub for the first time
        ever in my life! haha. Looking at tutorial's on youtube, I manged to
        stumble upon one that showed the basics of using Git-Hub on my mac.

        <h2>Git and Bash Commands I've learnt today</h2>
        <p>Bash Commands:
            <ol>
                <li>cd - Change Directory</li>
                <li>ls - List Directories</li>
                <li>open - Opens File in the current directory</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Git Commands:
            <ol>
                <li>git clone [URL]</li>
                <li>git status</li>
                <li>git add [FILE_NAME]</li>
                <li>git commit -m "message"</li>
                <li>git push</li>
                <li>git pull</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <h2>Starting HTML</h2>
    <p>Fortunately, there are plenty of free resources to learn Front End Web
    Development. One that i'm using is provided by <b><a
    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"> Free Code Camp </a></b></p>

    Curriculum" width="50%" height="50%">
    
    <p>With step-by-step instructions and hands on modules to complete, I've
    found that it's a great way to practice without having a project to work
    on.</p>
    
    <h3> Looking Forward in the Future</h3>
    <p>So far, the image above has shown the modules that I've progressed
    through, and hopefully is evident on this small blog. Looking forward, I
    hope that the next few blog posts will show the progress made, and thus
    you'll see how much 'better' each blogs are... hopefully. :D I'm also
    looking forward to improving my writing/blogging skills!</p>
        
    <h2>Current Problem's to solve</h2>

    <p>I've been using VS Code as my main IDE. I've used Bracket's as an IDE
    before, however, I would prefer to use VS Code since it has extensions for
    Python and Java, which are other programming languages that I would like to
    learn.</p>
    <p>Currently i've been looking into hard wrapping the code to put it into a
    newline, as the paragraphs tend to get lost along the large paragraph.</p>

    large paragraphs on VS Code" width="50%" height="50%">

    <p>Using the <a

    Extension by stkb managed to solve the problem.</p>>
