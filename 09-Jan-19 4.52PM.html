        <h1>My Progress Today Wed 09-January-2019</h1>
        <p>Today, I've started my learning progress on Front End Web
        Development. And what better way to track my progress by creating a blog
        on the daily progress I make on this journey. Unfortunately, I am not
        the best writer, however I am to make this blog as pleasant to read as
        possible</p>
        <h2>Git and Bash Commands I've learnt today</h2>
        <p>Bash Commands:
            <ol>
                <li>cd - Change Directory</li>
                <li>ls - List Directories</li>
                <li>open - Opens File in the current directory</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Git Commands:
            <ol>
                <li>git clone [URL]</li>
                <li>git status</li>
                <li>git add [FILE_NAME]</li>
                <li>git commit -m "message"</li>
                <li>git push</li>

    <h2>Current Problem's to solve</h2>
    <p>I've been using VS Code as my main IDE. I've used Bracket's as an IDE
    before, however, I would prefer to use VS Code since it has extensions for
    Python and Java, which are other programming languages that I would like to
    learn.</p>
    <p>Currently i've been looking into hard wrapping the code to put it into a
    newline, as the paragraphs tend to get lost along the large paragraph.</p>

    large paragraphs on VS Code">

    <p>Using the <a

    Extension by stkb managed to solve the problem.</p>>
