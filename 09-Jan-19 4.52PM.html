        <h1>My Progress Today Wed 09-January-2019</h1>
        <p>Today, I've started my learning progress on Front End Web
        Development. And what better way to track my progress by creating a blog
        on a daily/weekly progress. Unfortunately, I am not
        the best writer, however I aim to make this blog as pleasant to read as
        possible</p>
        <p>Starting the project, I looked into using Git-Hub for the first time
        ever in my life! haha. Looking at tutorial's on youtube, I manged to
        stumble upon one that showed the basics of using Git-Hub on my mac.

    <h2>Current Problem's to solve</h2>
    <p>I've been using VS Code as my main IDE. I've used Bracket's as an IDE
    before, however, I would prefer to use VS Code since it has extensions for
    Python and Java, which are other programming languages that I would like to
    learn.</p>
    <p>Currently i've been looking into hard wrapping the code to put it into a
    newline, as the paragraphs tend to get lost along the large paragraph.</p>

    <p>Using the <a

    Extension by stkb managed to solve the problem.</p>>
