        <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <article>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 205 Degrees Celcius (400 Fahrenheit)</li>

                    <li>Cut a little bit off the potatoes either side (longest side), to absorb the flavour of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Cut the potatoes in half as evenly as possible (longest side). No need to peel the potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Swish them around a bit to remove excess starch. <strong>
                    Removing excess starch</strong> helps to create a crunchier potato.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to dry paper towels, and blot-out to remove excess water.</li>
                    <li>Flip the potato over to the widest side face up</li>
                    <li>Season very generously with freshly ground black pepper, cayenne, and kosher salt.</li>

                    <li>Prepare the baking dish with a generous amount of olive oil (1/4 cup) and cover the bottom. Spread out the olive oil evenly along the
                    baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the potato with the larger seasoned-side face down. The face-up side should have no seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Brush over the top with olive oil, and generously season with black pepper, cayenne pepper, and kosher salt</li>

                    <li>Transfer the dish to the preheated oven, and leave in there for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After 20 minutes, very carefully flip the potatoes over to the largest side face-up. Suggested to use a spatula and tong, as there are
                    cautions that the oil is very hot.</li>
                    <li>Let it rest for 10 minutes, and Prepare the chicken broth.</li>
                    <li>Add a teaspoon of lemon zest to the chicken broth, and depending on how tangy you want it, add 1 or 2 lemons to the chicken broth.</li>
                    <li>Carefully spread the lemon-infused chicken broth over the potatoes. Be careful not to leave all the lemon zest on top of one potato.
                    Spread the lemon zest at the bottom of the baking tray.</li>
                    <li>Add a few sprigs of fresh oregano to the baking tray. About 1-4 sprigs.</li>
                    <li>Season with black pepper and salt a bit. Shake the tray and slosh it around, before adding back to the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After 15 minutes. Flip over once again. and <strong>cook for the remaining until the oil and liquid is absorbed</strong> into the
                    potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that these are cooked long enough!</li>
                </ol>
